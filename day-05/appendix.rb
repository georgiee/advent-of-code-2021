# 1. atan2 is a smart idea for the slope and could help getting rid of the dx/dy mess

# 2. R/Slotch was impressive

# 3. Standard Libraries
# See so many people with languages that have a great math standard library (numpy for example)
# it might help to use http://sciruby.com/ ?

# 4. Numeric 1 <=> 2 returns -1, 0, +1 or nil üòç
# See https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.0/Integer.html#method-i-3C-3D-3E

# here the ungolfed version of the linked solution. 
# I know of <=> being part of the enumerator implmenetation
# but I did not connect the lines to maek use of the return value of that operator. 
# So good!

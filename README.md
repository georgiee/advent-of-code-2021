# Advent of Code 2021
Back this year after I skipped 2019. This year I'm ~thinking about using Ruby or Nim~ using Ruby again.
I have already blocked some time every day for 24 successive days to follow the riddle. 
Maybe this year I get to the 24th riddle, I always gave up before in the past events.

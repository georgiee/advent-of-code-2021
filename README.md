# Advent of Code 2021
Back this year after I skipped 2019. This year I'm ~thinking about using Ruby or Nim~ using Ruby again.
I have already blocked some time every day for 24 successive days to follow the riddle. 
Maybe this year I get to the 24th riddle, I always gave up before in the past events.

+ [Day 01](day-01/)
+ [Day 02](day-02/)
+ [Day 03](day-03/)
+ [Day 04](day-04/)
+ [Day 05](day-05/)
+ [Day 06](day-06/)
+ [Day 07](day-07/)
+ [Day 08](day-08/)
+ [Day 09](day-09/)
